# Rust SMTP Server Documentation

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Project
This project aims to create a robust, secure, and efficient SMTP server implemented in Rust. The server is designed to handle both plain text and TLS-encrypted connections, providing a flexible solution for email handling.

### 1.2 Key Features
- Support for both plain text and TLS-encrypted connections
- Asynchronous I/O operations using Tokio
- SMTP protocol compliance
- Basic authentication mechanisms (AUTH LOGIN and AUTH PLAIN)
- Email storage in a local directory
- Configurable through environment variables

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- Rust programming language
- Tokio for asynchronous runtime
- Rustls for TLS implementation
- Base64 for encoding/decoding
- Chrono for timestamp generation
- Mailparse for email parsing
- Dotenv for environment variable management

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Overview
The SMTP server is built as a multi-threaded application that listens on two ports: one for plain text connections and another for TLS connections. It uses Tokio for asynchronous I/O operations, allowing it to handle multiple client connections efficiently.

### 2.2 Component Diagram

![SMTP Server Component Diagram](./img/2024-09-09-084653.svg)

This diagram illustrates the main components of our Rust SMTP server:

1. **TLS Listener**: Handles incoming TLS connections on port 8465.
2. **Plain Text Listener**: Handles incoming plain text connections on port 8025.
3. **Connection Handler**: Manages incoming connections from both listeners.
4. **Auth Handler**: Manages authentication processes (AUTH LOGIN and AUTH PLAIN).
5. **Email Processor**: Parses and processes incoming emails.
6. **SMTP Protocol Handler**: Implements SMTP commands and responses.
7. **Storage Manager**: Handles email storage in the local file system.
8. **Logging System**: Manages error logging and diagnostics.

The arrows indicate the flow of data and control between components. This diagram provides a high-level overview of how the different parts of our SMTP server interact.

#### 2.2.1 Project Structure

## Directory and File Descriptions

### `src/`
Contains all the Rust source code for the project.

- **`bin/`**: Holds binary executable entry points.
  - **`email_api.rs`**: Implements the email API functionality.
  - **`smtp_client.rs`**: Contains the SMTP client implementation.
  - **`smtp_server.rs`**: Houses the main SMTP server implementation.
- **`test-smtp.rs`**: Contains SMTP testing functionality.

### `emails/`
A directory for storing received emails.

### `img/`
Stores image assets used in the project or documentation.

### `target/`
The output directory for compiled code and dependencies (automatically generated by Cargo).

### `test-smtp/`
Additional resources or scripts related to SMTP testing.

### `mailing-lists/`
Directory for managing mailing lists.

### `Cargo.toml`
The manifest file for the Rust package, defining dependencies and project metadata.

### `Cargo.lock`
Ensures reproducible builds by locking dependency versions.

### `Dockerfile`
Defines the Docker container configuration for the application.

### `LICENSE`
The license file detailing the terms under which the project is distributed.

### `README.md`
Project documentation, including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and other relevant information.

### SSL/TLS-related files
- **`fullchain.pem`**: The full SSL/TLS certificate chain.
- **`localhost.crt`**: A self-signed certificate for local development.
- **`localhost.key`**: The private key for the local development certificate.
- **`privkey.pem`**: The private key for the SSL/TLS certificate.

This structure organizes the project into logical components, separating concerns between email functionality, API implementation, and server operations. It also includes necessary files for deployment, testing, and secure communication.

### 2.3 Data Flow
1. Client connects to the server (plain text or TLS)
2. Server authenticates the client (if required)
3. Client sends email data
4. Server processes and stores the email
5. Server sends confirmation to the client


### 2.4 Security Considerations
- TLS encryption for secure connections
- Authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access
- Proper handling of sensitive data (e.g., credentials, email content)

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Core Server Implementation

#### 3.1.1 TLS and Plain Text Connections
The server uses two separate TCP listeners: one for TLS connections and one for plain text. The TLS listener uses Rustls for secure connections, while the plain text listener allows for unencrypted communication.

#### 3.1.2 Asynchronous I/O with Tokio
Tokio is used to handle asynchronous I/O operations, allowing the server to handle multiple connections concurrently without blocking.

#### 3.1.3 SMTP Protocol Handling
The server implements basic SMTP commands such as HELO/EHLO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, DATA, and QUIT. It processes these commands in the `process_command` function.

### 3.2 Email Processing

#### 3.2.1 Parsing Incoming Emails
The server uses the `mailparse` crate to parse incoming emails, extracting relevant information such as sender, recipient, subject, and body.

#### 3.2.2 Email Storage System
Emails are stored in a local directory ("./emails") as .eml files. Each file is named with a timestamp and the recipient's email address.

### 3.3 Authentication Mechanisms

#### 3.3.1 AUTH LOGIN
The server supports the AUTH LOGIN mechanism, which involves a base64-encoded username and password exchange.

#### 3.3.2 AUTH PLAIN
The AUTH PLAIN mechanism is also supported, allowing for a single-step authentication process.

### 3.4 Certificate Handling
The server loads TLS certificates and private keys from files specified in the environment variables. It uses these for establishing TLS connections.

### 3.5 Error Handling and Logging
Errors are logged using the `log` crate, with different severity levels for various types of errors. The server attempts to gracefully handle errors and continue operation where possible.


### 3.6 Concurrency and Performance
The server utilizes Tokio's async runtime to handle multiple connections concurrently, improving overall performance and scalability.

## 4. Configuration

### 4.1 Server Configuration

#### 4.1.1 TLS Settings
TLS settings are configured using environment variables, including paths to certificate and key files.

#### 4.1.2 Listening Ports
The server listens on two ports: one for TLS connections and one for plain text. These are configurable via environment variables.

### 4.2 Environment Variables
- `SMTP_TLS_ADDR`: Address and port for TLS connections
- `SMTP_PLAIN_ADDR`: Address and port for plain text connections
- `CERT_PATH`: Path to the TLS certificate file
- `KEY_PATH`: Path to the TLS private key file
- `SMTP_USERNAME`: Username for authentication
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: Password for authentication

### 4.3 Certificates and Keys
The server requires a valid TLS certificate and private key for secure connections. These should be obtained from a trusted certificate authority and placed in a secure location on the server.

## 5. Deployment

### 5.1 System Requirements
- Rust 1.54 or later
- Sufficient disk space for email storage
- Network access for incoming connections

### 5.2 Installation Process
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `cargo build --release`
3. Set up the required environment variables
4. Ensure certificate and key files are in place

### 5.3 Running the Server
